# Artificial Intelligence in Remote Sensing

RCE is a distributed, workflow-based integration environment. Engineers and scientists use it to design and simulate complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites). OrbisGIS is a cross-platform open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) created by research and for research. VIAME is a computer vision application. Clara is a forward-chaining rules engine written in Clojure(Script) with Java interoperability. CasADi is a symbolic framework for numeric optimization implementing automatic differentiation in forward and reverse modes on sparse matrix-valued computational graphs. It supports self-contained C-code generation and interfaces state-of-the-art codes such as SUNDIALS, IPOPT etc. It can be used from C++, Python or Matlab/Octave. A PyTorch implementation of "GeoSynth: Contextually-Aware High-Resolution Satellite Image Synthesis". RaySAR is a 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) simulator which enables to generate SAR image layers related to detailed 3D object models. Open Source 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Simulator. RadarSimPy is a powerful and versatile Python-based Radar Simulator that models radar transceivers and simulates baseband data from point targets and 3D models. Polaris is an open-source tool used for the exploration and analysis of satellite telemetry data by building machine learning models. Raster Vision is an open source Python library and framework for building computer vision models on satellite, aerial, and other large imagery sets (including oblique drone imagery). CARS is a dedicated and open source 3D tool to produce Digital Surface Models from satellite imaging by photogrammetry. CityEngine is a 3D city modeling software for urban design, visual effects, and VR/AR production
