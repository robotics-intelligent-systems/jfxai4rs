# Artificial Intelligence in Remote Sensing

In current usage, the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or airborne-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. VIAME is a computer vision application. RadarSimPy is a powerful and versatile Python-based Radar Simulator that models radar transceivers and simulates baseband data from point targets and 3D models. Polaris is an open-source tool used for the exploration and analysis of satellite telemetry data by building machine learning models. Raster Vision is an open source Python library and framework for building computer vision models on satellite, aerial, and other large imagery sets (including oblique drone imagery). CARS is a dedicated and open source 3D tool to produce Digital Surface Models from satellite imaging by photogrammetry.
