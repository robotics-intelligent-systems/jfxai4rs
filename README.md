# Artificial Intelligence in Remote Sensing

In current usage, the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or airborne-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. Raster Vision is an open source Python library and framework for building computer vision models on satellite, aerial, and other large imagery sets (including oblique drone imagery). CARS is a dedicated and open source 3D tool to produce Digital Surface Models from satellite imaging by photogrammetry.
